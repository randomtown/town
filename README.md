# Town

**Digital Town** - modern, functional development environment for distributed
networks of ~~human~~ intelligent beings.

## Motivation

Since early 2000's, most of development efforts in distributed systems has
been dedicated to issues and ideas lobbied by massive online businesses, and
completely foreign to simple mortals: cloud computing, containarization,
advanced cryptography and cryptocurrencies, big-data, auto-scaling and massive
scale deployments a.k.a. orchestration. These efforts led to shift in
specialization of software developers. **Creative** problem solving and hacking
for **fun** has been gradually replaced with operations, while at the same time,
inflating complexity of operated tools and their internal mechanisms. Take for
instance the statistics on [Docker](https://docker.io) provided by [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/p/docker):

> In a nutshell, docker...
>
> ... has had 41,755 commits, made by 2,194 contributors, representing 547,828
> lines of code.
>
> ... took an estimated 151 years of effort (COCOMO model).

These statistics, as well as overall look at _modern_ massive scale systems,
show an analogy to early-day mainframes. Just like mainframes back in 60's and
70's, current production systems require an insane amount of skilled ~~human~~
intelligent components to carry on with operations, at the same time raising
frustration and impotence of regular developers. That grim status quo, gave us
spark of motivation to shift perspective and try something different.

## Project Goals

As Arthur Shopenhauer claims in  _Chapter XXII_ of his _Short Philosophical
Essays_:

> Just as the largest library, badly arranged, is not so useful as a very
> moderate one that is well arranged, so the greatest amount of knowledge,
> if not elaborated by our own thoughts, is worth much less than a far smaller
> volume that has been abundantly and repeatedly thought over. For only by
> universally combining what we know, by comparing every truth with every other,
> do we fully assimilate our own knowledge and get it into our power. We can
> think over only what we know, and so we should learn something; but we know
> only what we have thought out.

As the prospect of living in a grim, baddly arranged, digital metropolies is
not appealing whatsoever, **our efforts shift toward development of orderly
building blocks for networked and cozy digital towns.** Therefore, our goal is
to provide a **moderate library for self-thinkers, who are able to learn from
accumulated knowledge and use it to shape their own ideas into digital work.**
